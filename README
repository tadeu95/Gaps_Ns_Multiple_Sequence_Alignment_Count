The file contains four simple python functions: the first (Ngap_position_count) to count the number of gaps or Ns in every position of a multiple sequence alignment in fasta format, the second (save_as_df) to save the result as a data frame in a tsv file, the third (plot_Ngap_counts) to plot the results and save the plot in pdf, png or svg and the fourth (cut_alignment) to trim the sequences in the alignment by input positions.
